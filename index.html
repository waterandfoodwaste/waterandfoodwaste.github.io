              <h2>Why it’s important to reduce water wastage</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>70% of the water used by people is used to water crops and livestock for food production. A lack of water could therefore lead to shortages in food around the world.</li>
                <li>Reduced freshwater for agriculture and livestock could increase the demand and cost of produce or discourage new or old farmers from continuing their profession.</li> 
                <li>A lack of water in reservoirs or rivers could impact hydroelectricity plants, which play a major role in the production of electricity.</li> 
                <li>Industries dependent on water may face immense problems due to water shortage, leading to economic shutdowns which would affect millions of people.</li> 
                <li>25% of all freshwater used in America is drained on food waste, which could go to countries deprived of freshwater or conserved for future usage. Water wastage in First world countries could lead to lesser freshwater for Third world countries.</li>
                <li>36 countries around the world including Sudan and Venezuela have an ‘extremely stressed’ freshwater condition. Many countries in optimal conditions also face a decline in freshwater.</li>

              <h2>Why it’s important to reduce food wastage</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>A large percentage of freshwater is used for agriculture and livestock. Therefore, if food is wasted, water and other minerals used in fertilisers are also indirectly wasted.</li>
                <li>Almost 11% of the Earth’s land is used for agricultural purposes. Thus, food wastage leads to loss of usable land as land dedicated to agriculture cannot be used for anything else.</li>
                <li>This wasted land also affects biodiversity around the world as animals lose more of their natural habitats every day to gain enough land to meet agricultural demands.</li>
                <li>Food waste in landfills produce methane and carbon dioxide as they break down which contributes to global warming and climate change.</li>
                <li>An estimated 1.6 billion tons of food gets wasted every year- nearly a third of all food production. This leads to an economic loss of 750 billion dollars per annum.</li>
                <li>Wasting or overbuying food also wastes money as expired food or food disposed irresponsibly is wasted expenses.</li>
                <li>Despite such amounts of food available to waste, countries like Yemen continue to face severe famines which lead to millions of deaths every year.</li>

        <h2>How to save water in your own house</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep aerators on taps</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Faucets or taps are the second biggest water consumers in a house. Installing aerators don’t affect water pressure but can reduce the water used by taps by up to 40%! 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Check for leaks in different appliances including toilets, pipes, faucets, etc.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Even a small leak can cause lots of water to be wasted per day as leaks waste water 24/7. Checking for such leaks may be as easy as adding food colouring to a toilet tank and checking for unaided flow! </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Don’t use toilets to flush waste</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Flushing waste like band aids, ear picks, etc. down toilets use the same amount of water as a full flush. This means nearly 6 litres of water is wasted on just a single item that could’ve been discarded in a bin! </li>
              </ul>
            <li>Take shorter showers or use a bucket</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Taking shorter showers or limiting your water use to a bucket for bathing can save several litres of water per day!</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Close taps when not in use</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Small amounts of water wasted from taps can add up to incredible amounts in the long term. Closing taps while brushing, applying soap, etc. can save quite a bit of water!</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Teach children about the problems of water waste</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Teaching children about the problem of water shortage can lead to them being more careful with water and will help them become more responsible citizens in the future!</li>
              </ul>

          <h2>How to save food in your own house</h2>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Practise “First in-First out”</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Trying to use older instead of newer ingredients can save a lot of food from going unused or getting rotten!</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Keep a grocery list for buying</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ensuring you know what you need to buy before entering a store can help reduce both your spending and food waste!</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Make use-it-up meals</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pooling leftover ingredients or food for a meal once every few weeks can help waste much less leftover food, and may even make for a good cooking experiment and meal!</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Keeping an eye on expiration dates before buying</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Accidentally buying old food can lead to waste. Helpful tip- a lot of foods stay edible even after the printed date as this may be a best before rather than use by date!</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Share extra food and leftovers from parties</li>  
                <ul>
                  <li>A study by the Food Ministry, Government of India found that about 20% of food at social events such as weddings and parties gets wasted. If you are a part of any such function or event, reach out to nearby food banks that help give the hungry access to this food.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Teach children about the problems of food waste</li> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Teaching children about the issues of famines and food waste around the world leads to them being more responsible and teaches them the importance of the food they eat.</li>
